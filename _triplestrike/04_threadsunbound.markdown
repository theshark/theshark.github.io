## Summary

A year has passed since the Republic of Pirates declared its independence from the IPC, leading to a massive shift in the interstellar powers. Making matters worse, the Republic claims Svenâ€™s beloved sister, Hildegarde, is their traitorous leader.

Meanwhile, Alan languishes on Earth. Exiled from the Swallow, Alan has been branded a spy by the pyreans and faces charges of treason in the human courts. Though he's abandoned any hope of reuniting with Sven, his fortunes shift when he receives a surprise visit from an old friend.

An unexpected ally has opened a final way forward. One last chance to bring Steele to justice. One last chance to discover the truth about Hilde. One last chance to uncover corruption within the IPC. And if Sven and Alan have to get married to crack the case? Well, there are worse sacrifices to make!

Threads Unbound is the fourth book in the Triple Strike series, and it includes seven illustrations plus additional bonus content.
