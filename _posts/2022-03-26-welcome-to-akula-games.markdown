Akula Games has been on hiatus for the past few years, both in terms of contracting and working on personal development, but I'm about ready to get back into personal projects (but not contracted work)! Several project announcements are coming soon, and this webpage will slowly be evolving out of its current "professional" projection of the company and more into a vehicle for my personal projects and whatever associated blogging I feel like doing that's related. This means not only games, but writings, art, research, and whatever else I get up to and feel like sharing.

You might be thinking "if you do all that, the name 'Akula Games' won't really fit anymore, will it?" You're probably right, but as a counterpoint, the more I think about "games" the more I think about the Latin word for "games" which is _ludus_. Ludus, interestingly, is also the word for plays, sports, and school. That is to say, it means "fun." Games are fun, creative pursuits are fun, learning is fun.

So in that spirit, Akula Games fits just fine -- and mixing Russian and Latin for an English-speaking company would be a bit overdramatic, right? (Also let's not think too hard about trying to decline "akula" and "ludus" together in a sensible way).
